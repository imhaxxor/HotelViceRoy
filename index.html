                One beautiful thing about a hotel with a top-view table is that it provides guests with a stunning vantage point from which to enjoy the surrounding area. The view from a top-view table could include sweeping panoramas of the city skyline, mountain ranges, or beautiful birds. <br><br> Having a top-view table in a hotel can create a memorable and romantic experience for couples or a unique and enjoyable experience for friends or solo travelers. It can also be a great spot for a special occasion, such as a birthday or anniversary celebration.. <br><br> Additionally, a top-view table can provide a sense of luxury and exclusivity, as it may be located in a private or semi-private area of the hotel with limited access to other guests. This can add to the overall sense of relaxation and enjoyment for those who are able to use the space.

                When Mexican hotelier, Alberto Del Rio, founded the Imperial Palace in 1998, he redefined the European restaurant scene and paved the way for a new style of modern hospitality, conceived on a simple premise: ‘doing normal things in an extraordinary manner’.
                <br><br> A visionary of his time, Prager created a restaurant concept based on simplicity, innovation, commitment to service and a passion for culinary and hospitality excellence, and the rest, as they say, is history.
